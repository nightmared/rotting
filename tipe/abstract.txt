Over the last decade, artificial neurals networks have drawn a huge interest in the research community. In this presentation, we will discuss the use of simple neural networks to recognise borders between various environments so as to showcase their internals, especially the back-propagation algorithm. To do so, we subdivide satellite images into thumbnails, which are then checked for borders. For thoses that does contain a border, a second neural network generate a bezier curve matching the contour line of that subdivision. We can now chain these curves together to get the complete border of the image.
